      # How are timezones managed?
      # * Take into account the timezone offset throughout the search,
      #   so that the periods are correctly grouped.
      # * Restore the timezone at the very end to return the date in UTC
      #   being consistent with the Rails convention

      # What does it do?
      # 1. group currently selected rows by the interval
      # 2. trim out unneeded rows if query is not cumulative
      # 3. make a union to add possible missing time points
      # 4. iterate over a window function that can cumulate the previous counters if needed
      # 5. trim out rows outside the time window
      #    Cannot be done before in the same query because window function iterates after the
      #    where/group by/having clauses (could be improved for non cumulative queries)
